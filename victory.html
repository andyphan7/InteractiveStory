    <b>Congratulations,</b> you've deemed worthy, following through with your decision.<br>
    For a split second, I was finally able to recover my present memories, and <br>
    thought about my kids, and how I could die trying to save these people. <br>
    What made me able to override my fear, was being a part of something, <br>
    and having the courage to do something, when others couldn't.


    
    Heroes tend to act impulsively, without thinking about danger.</p>

  <b>The End:</b> Earlier in the story, it was stated that I woke up from a dream,<br>
   but that never actually happened. I was still in a coma, and I realized that when I traveled<br>
   to the past, I was only able to see black and white colors. This entire occurence was a dream,<br>
   And a lesson, that sometimes you just have to <b>follow your heart, no matter the consequences.</b>
