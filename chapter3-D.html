            They're enjoying their time beating up innocent kids, knocking the wind and blood out of their body.. </i>
            As you approach the cabin, you find a 1911 Winchester gun, but realize that there's no ammo loaded, so it deems useless. <br>
            <b>But,</b> you still have the portal gun. What do you decide to do? The choice is <b>yours.</b>
